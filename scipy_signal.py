def fftconvolve(in1, in2, mode="full"):
    """Convolve two N-dimensional arrays using FFT.

    Convolve `in1` and `in2` using the fast Fourier transform method, with
    the output size determined by the `mode` argument.

    This is generally much faster than `convolve` for large arrays (n > ~500),
    but can be slower when only a few output values are needed, and can only
    output float arrays (int or object array inputs will be cast to float).

    Parameters
    ----------
    in1 : array_like
        First input.
    in2 : array_like
        Second input. Should have the same number of dimensions as `in1`;
        if sizes of `in1` and `in2` are not equal then `in1` has to be the
        larger array.
    mode : str {'full', 'valid', 'same'}, optional
        A string indicating the size of the output:

        ``full``
           The output is the full discrete linear convolution
           of the inputs. (Default)
        ``valid``
           The output consists only of those elements that do not
           rely on the zero-padding.
        ``same``
           The output is the same size as `in1`, centered
           with respect to the 'full' output.

    Returns
    -------
    out : array
        An N-dimensional array containing a subset of the discrete linear
        convolution of `in1` with `in2`.

def chirp(t, f0, t1, f1, method='linear', phi=0, vertex_zero=True):
    """Frequency-swept cosine generator.

    In the following, 'Hz' should be interpreted as 'cycles per time unit';
    there is no assumption here that the time unit is one second.  The
    important distinction is that the units of rotation are cycles, not
    radians.

    Parameters
    ----------
    t : ndarray
        Times at which to evaluate the waveform.
    f0 : float
        Frequency (in Hz) at time t=0.
    t1 : float
        Time at which `f1` is specified.
    f1 : float
        Frequency (in Hz) of the waveform at time `t1`.
    method : {'linear', 'quadratic', 'logarithmic', 'hyperbolic'}, optional
        Kind of frequency sweep.  If not given, `linear` is assumed.  See
        Notes below for more details.
    phi : float, optional
        Phase offset, in degrees. Default is 0.
    vertex_zero : bool, optional
        This parameter is only used when `method` is 'quadratic'.
        It determines whether the vertex of the parabola that is the graph
        of the frequency is at t=0 or t=t1.

    Returns
    -------
    y : ndarray
        A numpy array containing the signal evaluated at `t` with the
        requested time-varying frequency.  More precisely, the function
        returns ``cos(phase + (pi/180)*phi)`` where `phase` is the integral
        (from 0 to `t`) of ``2*pi*f(t)``. ``f(t)`` is defined below.

    See Also
    --------
    sweep_poly

    Notes
    -----
    There are four options for the `method`.  The following formulas give
    the instantaneous frequency (in Hz) of the signal generated by
    `chirp()`.  For convenience, the shorter names shown below may also be
    used.

    linear, lin, li:

        ``f(t) = f0 + (f1 - f0) * t / t1``

    quadratic, quad, q:

        The graph of the frequency f(t) is a parabola through (0, f0) and
        (t1, f1).  By default, the vertex of the parabola is at (0, f0).
        If `vertex_zero` is False, then the vertex is at (t1, f1).  The
        formula is:

        if vertex_zero is True:

            ``f(t) = f0 + (f1 - f0) * t**2 / t1**2``

        else:

            ``f(t) = f1 - (f1 - f0) * (t1 - t)**2 / t1**2``

        To use a more general quadratic function, or an arbitrary
        polynomial, use the function `scipy.signal.waveforms.sweep_poly`.

    logarithmic, log, lo:

        ``f(t) = f0 * (f1/f0)**(t/t1)``

        f0 and f1 must be nonzero and have the same sign.

        This signal is also known as a geometric or exponential chirp.

    hyperbolic, hyp:

        ``f(t) = f0*f1*t1 / ((f0 - f1)*t + f1*t1)``

        f1 must be positive, and f0 must be greater than f1.
